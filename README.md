# crystal-widgets

A set of system monitoring widgets for the Übersicht application.

# Description

`crystal-widgets` is a collection of widgets primarily focused on system performance monitoring, designed to enhance your desktop experience. These widgets provide real-time information on your system's performance, including CPU usage, memory consumption, and a basic system profile. The design is minimalist with a glass-like aesthetic, contributing both functionality and visual appeal to your desktop.

The core monitoring functionality leverages a custom build of the performance monitor `htop`. Binaries for both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures are included in the widget package. If you prefer to build these binaries yourself, you can find the necessary resources at [crystal-htop](https://github.com/locupleto/crystal-htop).
